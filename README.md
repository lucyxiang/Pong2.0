We Unity to create the game physics and design, and using Leap Motion's SDK which integrates directly with Unity. The game has various input modes including mouse, keyboard, and the Leap Motion controller, and various combinations of these in signle player or multiplayer mode. The most interactive game mode is playing multiplayer with the single Leap Motion controller; it is able to independently track each hand and move each players paddle.

Start menu with options:

- Single Player

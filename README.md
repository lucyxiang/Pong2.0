# Pong 2.0 🔥 🏓 🖥

Project made at McHacks 2018 involving reimagining the classic game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a> in three dimensions. You can play the game – in the old-fashioned way – using your mouse or keyboard, or you can step into 2018🔥 and use a <a href = "https://www.leapmotion.com">Leap Motion Controller</a> to control the game with your hands.

## People Choice Award 🙌🏼 🎉 🎊
